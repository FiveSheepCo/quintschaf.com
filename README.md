## Contributing

1. Commit code changes without the `docs/` folder<br>
   _This is needed for better commit readability and code review._
2. Place files that should be added to the `docs/` folder in `docs-extra/`.
3. Our GitHub Workflow will automatically deploy changes once they're merged into `master`.
