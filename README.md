## Contributing

1. Commit code changes without the docs/ folder
   _This is needed for better commit readability and code review._
2. Commit the docs/ folder separately with the commit message :hammer: Build
   _So we can easily identify pure builds without code changes._

## Building

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve
```
